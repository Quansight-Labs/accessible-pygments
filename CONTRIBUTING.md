## Creating your development environment 👩🏻‍💻 👨🏼‍💻

For creating your development environment locally you will need to have the following tools installed:

- 🐍 An environment manager like `conda` or `pyenv`
- 📝 `git`
- Python >= 3.9

### Fork this repository ⏬

Fork this repository to your profile and clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <LINK-TO-YOUR-FORK>
```

Remember that this fork is a copy of the repository and any change done in it doesn't affect the original one.

### Install dependencies 💽

Once you have the local clone in your machine, you need to install the dependencies.
You can create a new environment for this project and install the dependencies there:

```bash
conda create -n a11y-pygments-dev python=3.9
conda activate a11y-pygments-dev
pip install -e .
```

After running these instructions you will have an environment named `a11y-pygments-dev`, with the requirements installed and this package installed in development version.

### Run the tests 🏃🏻‍♀️ 🏃‍♂️

Once the development environment is ready run the following command:

```bash
python test/run_tests.py
```

You will see the results under `test/results` in HTML format for each supported theme.
We recommend using your favorite browser to see the rich HTML output.

## Adding a new theme 🎨

### Where to add a new theme 👩🏼‍🎨

Our package is divided by themes, where each folder has the style of each theme, a description in Markdown and the source CSS file.

```text
├── a11y_pygments
│   ├── a11y_dark
│   │   ├── style.py
│   │   ├── style.css
│   │   ├── README.md
│   ├── a11y_light
│   │   ├── style.py
│   │   ├── style.css
│   │   ├── README.md
```

To add a new theme, please create a folder with your new theme name, like `white-cats` and add the three files described before (so that it matches the rest of the themes).

### Customize your `style.py` file

You can use as a base one of our existing themes, this file needs to define a new class named `Theme` with the new colors and rules you want.

> **NOTE** 📝
> Please try to encapsulate all the raw colors in the `Colors` `enum` and call them in the rules section. This will help us with maintenance 🙏.

### Visualize and debug your theme

To see and debug your theme re-install the package via:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Then generate the HTML results:

```bash
python test/run_tests.py
```

If successful, you should be able to see the results of your new theme under `test/results/<your-theme>` in HTML format.

### Update the `README.md` file

Once you are happy with the colors and the rules in the style file, please update the README for your new theme!

The **most** important part for us, is to add a table with the contrast ratios of the colors you've chosen and their compliance to WCAG. Please use any of the current themes as a base, and use any color contrast checker to fill it out.

Any acknowledgements to other repositories that you may use as base please add them as well to the main [README](./README.md) in the repo under the `acknowledgements` section.

Also, don't forget to add the name of your theme to our list of supported themes in the main README.

### Generate source `style.css` file

You can generate the CSS file automatically through:

```bash
python a11y_pygments/test/run_css.py
```

The file should appear in the folder of your new theme.

#### Add your theme to our static page

We have a demo page where you will be able to change the style of different languages at the same time.
To add your new theme please go to the file `test/index.html`. Under themes, we have a link to all the generated CSS files.

You will have to manually add a new link to your new theme:

```HTML
...
<!-- themes -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" title="a11y dark" href="./../a11y_pygments/a11y_dark/style.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" title="YOUR THEME HERE" href="./../a11y_pygments/<your-theme>/style.css">
...

```

With this change you will be able to open `test/index.html` in your favorite browser and find your new theme in our demo!

### Create a Pull Request

Once you have the folder with the described files, please open a Pull Request 👏🏻
